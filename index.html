    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23prayforparis&src=typd">#PrayforParis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23metoo&src=tyah">#MeToo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NeverAgain&src=tyah">#NeverAgain</a>. These are hashtags that have mobilized
        and united people all around the world in, what would have once taken
        months, hours or even minutes. Social media platforms, especially
        Twitter, are vectors for this magnitude of social impact. This spread of information
        attracts attention, drives action among groups and individuals, and creates a global network effect.
        <br /><br />
        Twitter has been used as a core medium to share experiences
        and gain global traction around crises. In September of 2017,
        people used Twitter to share about Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. People
        and companies, like <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/budweiser-super-bowl-2018_us_5a7777d8e4b0905433b578d6">Budweiser</a>, have united around relief efforts to support
        this disaster. More recently, students at the shooting at Parkland High School
        in Florida used Twitter and other forms of social media to share their first-hand
        experiences at the site of the shooting. The circulating videos and pictures
        on social media have gained global traction, and have empowered citizens
        and companies, like Dick's Sporting Goods, to take action.
        <br /><br />
        This analysis explores how social media, specifically Twitter, has driven
        change around a crisis. Specifically, it explores how Twitter and online
        traction differs between the two types of crises: shootings and natural disasters.
        I analyzed the spread of content, its effect on stimulating online discussion and
        interest, and compared and contrasted the content between shooting crises and natural disasters.

    <!-- Data and Methods -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4">Data &amp; Sources</h3>
      <p>
        In order to perform the analysis on three-dimensions, I fetched data from
        multiple sources. I used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf">twitteR</a>
        to pull tweets regarding both types of crises. I then used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/index.html">gtrendsR</a>, a R package
        that allows API calls to fetch Google Trends data, to retrieve information
        on online interest over time regarding the direct topics ("Parkland Florida School Shooting",
        "Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria") and its broader topics ("Gun Violence", "Disaster Relief") that
        have been focal points of the respective post-crises discussions.
        <br/></br/>
        In order to perform content analysis on the Tweets, I used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/syuzhet.pdf">syuzhet</a>, a
        sentiment analysis package, and its dependent package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/stringr.pdf">stringr</a>.
        I chose the <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC emotion lexicon</a> method to add more color to the text analysis.
        <br/></br/>
        In terms of visualization, I used <a href="http://plot.ly/r" >plotly</a> and <a href="http://ggplot2.org">ggplot2</a>.
        Visualizations were then exported as PNG files or uploaded to the plot.ly server.

      <h3 class="title is-4">How has online engagement impacted civic engagement?</h3>
      <p>
        Some say that it should not take an tragic event like a shooting to spur
        discussion around gun violence. Similarly, it shouldn't take a territory
        left in devestation to start discussions around how to relieve people and
        provide aid. But how do people actually behave? In this analysis, I focused
        how online engagement, driven by various forms of media including Twitter,
        have changed around political topics.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Online Interest around Hurricane Maria</h4>
      <p class="subtitle is-6">Hurricane Maria stimulated interest around disaster relief</p>
      <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~tifchang/5.embed"></iframe>
      <p>
        Disaster relief has been a topic at mind over the 30 days around Hurricane Maria.
        Hurricane Maria significantly drove people's engagement around disaster relief.
        However, what's interesting to note is the steeper decreasing rate of engagement
        around the direct topic and the lower decreasing rate of interest around
        disaster relief. <br />
        During this time, I believe that people were moved into discussion
        around these topics. This crisis enabled opportunities for
        companies like Budweiser to take action. As individuals and companies began to take action
        and consider how to be prepared to aid future disasters, the
        discussion around the direct event may have tapered, but online media still provided
        a medium for people to discuss a better future around the broader topic.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Where has online engagement spread?</h4>
      <p class="subtitle is-6">States near Puerto Rico have been mobilized to take action.</p>
      <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~tifchang/9.embed"></iframe>
      <p>
        Traction also spread world wide, but the concentration of engagement was
        in Puerto Rico and the United States. I hypothesized
        that this was driven primarily by geographic proximity and that other countries
        didn't necessarily find it a duty to provide aid to this situation. However, what is
        interesting is the discrepancy between online engagement in "disaster relief" vs "Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria".
        Around this time, Hurricane Harvey just hit Houston, TX. This could have driven the engagement with
        disaster relief elsewhere outside of Puerto Rico and potentially have neglected
        responsibility with aiding Puerto Rico.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Online Interest around Parkland Shooting</h4>
      <p class="subtitle is-6">The Parkland shooting significantly drove discussion on gun violence</p>
      <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~tifchang/3.embed"></iframe>
      <p>
        Despite the number of shootings since Columbine, it's interesting to see how
        significantly the Parkland shooting in Florida drove online engagement around
        gun violence. Relative to the discussion around "disaster relief", which has also
        been spurred previously by other natural disasters worldwide, online interest on
        gun violence increased from nearly 0. More importantly, as engagement around
        the direct event "Parkland Florida School Shooting" steeply droped, engagement
        around "gun violence" remained. <br />
        Students after the event were empowering others to make change on gun ownership
        rules and have ignited advocacy against gun violence using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NeverAgain&src=tyah">#NeverAgain</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="./img/fl_tweet.png" width="300px"/>
        </div>
      <p>
        As news sources have reported, this was the first time social media, like
        Twitter and Snapchat, had huge presences in creating change on gun violence, as
        students were able to record the event and continuously share their
        testimonies. This caused the online discussion to remain lively and active even
        after the event.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Where has online engagement spread?</h4>
      <p class="subtitle is-6">Cities all over the U.S. are engaged.</p>
      <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~tifchang/7.embed"></iframe>
      <p>
        Cities around the immediate area were the most engaged. However,
        engagement spread all across the U.S. evenly. This showed that
        despite location, gun violence was an issue many empathize and engage with especially
        given the number of episodes of shootings within the U.S. since the 1990's.

    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4">How does the circulating content compare between crises?</h3>
      <p>
        Amidst a crisis, we can anticipate relatively negative sentiment (sadness, anger, frustration).
        Normalizing for a baseline negative sentiment, tweets revolving around
        Parkland' shooting exhibited slightly more positive sentiment.
      </p> <br />
      <p><i>* Emotion-text association under NRC calibrates negative values with sad,
            anger, frustration, disgust and positive values with happy, love, and appreciation.
            These values are summed across a 20 tweets per crisis subset.
      </i></p>
      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Hurricane Maria Tweet Sentiment</h4>
      <p class="subtitle is-6">Tweets resembled relatively neutral sentiment.</p>
      <img src="./img/pr_sentiment.png"/>
      <p>
        Diving deeper into the tweets, the content regarding Hurricane Maria were centered
        around the still rising death counts despite the elapsed time. Furthermore,
        there has been significant debate to see what President Trump will do to aid. Since
        significant time has elapsed since the incident, much of the content analyzed
        are around relief efforts and prolonging suffering, giving the analysis
        a neutral to negative bias in comparison to the shooting. <br />
        It's interesting to note that in the Parkland shooting tweets, there are some
        positive sentiments despite how recent the event is. This is mostly attributed
        to by posts of hope, prayer, and solidarity.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4">Conclusion</h3>
      <h4 class="title is-5">Disclaimers</h4>
      <p>
        There are a few limitations to my analysis. Twitter's API does not permit
        fetching tweets beyond a week of the current day. Therefore, it was difficult
        to fetch the tweets around the time of the crisis to perform a sentiment
        analysis on. I am aware that the tweets I performed my analysis on were skewed
        towards a specific type of tweet. For example, I hypothesize that tweets closer
        to the date of the event are a lot more emotional since the event is still
        fresh. The early tweeters and retweeters around a crisis tend to be more
        emotional and therefore kickstart the inertia around calling people to action
        around "gun violence" and "disaster relief". However, it was still interesting
        to compare and contrast the sentiment around these two crises in light of their
        time frame differences. Regarding tracking the trends of broader topics and visualization, I
        did not take into account the effect other natural disasters within that timeline
        had on the data. For example, around the same time, Houston experienced a
        disasterous hurricane, which drove a high count for engagement in "disaster relief"
        around Texas.
      </p> <br />
      <h4 class="title is-5">Looking Forward</h4>
      <p>
        Looking forward, I'd like to look at content across various mediums
        since not all countries are effectively using Twitter as frequently
        as countries like the US, Canada, and UK. In order to get a more comprehensive
        view, I'd look into WeChat, WhatsApp, and more. If I had time, I would normalize
        the graph for sentiment analysis against a baseline level of negative sentiment
        around crises. I'd do so by looking at the average sentiment around crises
        using a larger data set of content (by finding ways to bypass API limitation).
        Overall, this analysis has given me
        more insight on how people respond to crises on social media and how it
        drives other topic engagements.
