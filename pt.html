    <h1 class="title is-4">Professor Tambe's Most Frequently Used Words</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle is-6">A lexicon driven by research, curriculum and passion.</h2>

      Industries are dynamically shifting, and the significance data plays in
      terms of decision making continues to grow. Professor Tambe is a passionate advocate for
      equipping students at Wharton with the necessary tools to enter all industries. He
      believes in fully grasping the fundamental data tools, like R, tableau, and S.Q.L. (he says
      'es-kyo͞o-el', not sequel, he's a man of his time), to develop upon future skills
      like "machine learning", and throw around big words with integrity like "big data".
      How did I jump to this conclusion?
      If you listen to his word choice, you might just understand what this man is all about.<br /><br />
      This analysis focuses on the word choice Professor Tambe uses over the course of OIDD 215.
      It provides unique insights into the course's primary focus as well as probably the most
      important 10 things you should take away from this class.

    <h2 class="title is-5">Data Source &amp; Methods</h2>
    <p>
      The data was collected first-hand. I tracked key words in his
      lecture content. Occasionally, when I was not paying attention, the lecture
      slides helped me calibrate to the potential key words that could appear.
      I also used <i>Stickies</i>, an application compatible with OSX operating systems,
      that allowed me to keep a simple tally on 10 key words. Some difficulties I faced was
      deciding on the key words. I had an initial set of 6, but over time realized there were other
      words that were also relevant. Therefore, some of my data may be skewed since tracking
      commenced only after I had made the decision to track it. However, I have full
      faith that this sophisticated procedure and the technologically advanced tools
      have more than enabled me to collect the sufficient data for this indepth analysis.

    <h2 class="title is-5">Drivers</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Events and factors that drive major trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Labs</b>: on classes we have labs, we exhibit a drastic decrease in the overall word count.
      That's because PT does not speak very much, if at all. Most of his word count is spent at the individual level, between
      a single student. I've chosen to not include this level of analysis since there is too much variation. PT fields questions
      ranging from "Why is my Tableau showing me one dot?" to "I can't turn on R" to "Can we eat at Pod?". Therefore, this creates too much noise in the analysis and
      it is best to stay with lecture content.</li> <br />
      <li><b>Exams</b>: similar to labs, PT does not talk during exams. He spends most of his time drinking coffee instead. This makes sense
      as, contrasting to a normal class or Slack, we can't rely on PT (or even Juan for that matter) to answer all our petty questions 24/7 on-demand.</li> <br />
      <li><b>Topics</b>: the class is broken down by topics. Therefore, word choice is heavily (basically directly) influenced by the topic being taught.
      However, PT occasionally mixes these topics (and therefore words across topics have non-zero frequencies) to emphasize how
      this course comes together to make students "fully equipped data scientists" such that we will get any of those jobs from McKinsey, Intel, or Indeed postings he lists on the slides. Contrary to popular belief, PT believes we are in high demand on the job market.</li><br />
      <li><b>Intros &amp; Conclusions</b>: PT occasionally has lectures that don't include any new content but more or less is a peptalk for us
        to realize we're worth more and better at analytics than we think we are. This is the time he drops a lot of the buzzwords to better acquaint us with how to properly use it so that one day we can use them and not sound like fools.</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />
    <h2 class="title is-5">Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Driven by the "Intros &amp; Conclusions" factor, we exhibit a U-shaped trend line
      for most of the words. However, when crossing certain topics, we see significant spikes
      (like "R") on days the topic is introduced. Since the course was only taught over 14
      classes, a few of those which were labs, it's difficult to see a consistent trend
      with the words.
      Amazon and McKinsey takes a precedence as the only proper nouns. PT praises these firms
      as the "#1 recruiter" and "consulting firm that doesn't start with a B", and makes
      an effort to remind us of the ever-shifting job industry. From this analysis, we are to forever remember
      that these firms outplace Google, Facebook, BCG, and Bain, since PT did not prioritize them.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2 class="title is-5">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      It's good to note that this analysis was done out of sheer boredom on a 10 hour flight
      to Hawaii, but to not discount that PT was the Professor we all hoped for
      our first years at Wharton. Yes, the data is real. Deuces–see ya'll in 245.
