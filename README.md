# Tweeting Crises
Course: OIDD 215  
Project: Data Project 2  
Description: This project explores the propagation of information around major crises events through Twitter. Social media has been a major focal point as a tool to spread information, build engagement, and start movements towards change. In this analysis, I am comparing two types of crises: shootings and natural disasters. I analyze the sentiment on the tweets, its location propagation over time, and compare them against each other.
